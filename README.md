Node.js API Starter
=======================

A boilerplate for Node.js API starter using Express, MongoDB and Passport

You can easily start a project, just pick a web framework and plug it on this API. 

**Note:** This project was created from [Hackaton Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter)

Features
--------

- **Local Authentication** using Email and Password
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication** via Facebook, Google
- Forgot Password with email via [Nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer)
- Reset Password

Prerequisites
-------------

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads) or a distant MongoDB ([mLab](https://mlab.com/) or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/))
- [Node.js 8.0+](http://nodejs.org)
- Command Line Tools
- Text Editor (ex: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io/))

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/vinigg2/thechecker-api myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon). 
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.


Obtaining API Keys
------------------

To use any of the included APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need
to obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or
Username & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new
credentials.

I have included dummy keys and passwords for all API examples to get you up and running even faster. But don't forget to update them with *your credentials* when you are ready to deploy an app.

- Visit <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console/project" target="_blank">Google Cloud Console</a>
- Click on the **Create Project** button
- Enter *Project Name*, then click on **Create** button
- Then click on **APIs & Services** in the sidebar
- Click on **Enabled APIs and services** button
- Now search **Google+ API**, click on it and then click on **Enable** button
- Go back to home by clicking on **Google Cloud Platform logo**
- Next, under *APIs & Services* in the sidebar click on **Credentials** tab
- Before creating credentials, go to tabs **OAuth Consent Screen*, fill *Application name* and click on **Save** button at the bottom
- Then, click on **Create credentials > OAuth client ID**
- Select *Web Application*
- Now, fill out the required fields:
    - **Name**: The name you want
    - **Authorized Javascript origins**: http://localhost:8080
    - **Authorized redirect URI**: http://localhost:8080/auth/google/callback
- Click on **Create** button
- Copy and paste *Client ID* and *Client secret* keys into `.env`

**Warning:** Facebook api need https to work *(for Facebook Login OAuth Redirect URIs)*.

You're going to use **Ngrok** ! Install it from [here](https://ngrok.com/) or with `npm install ngrok -g`
You must start ngrok after starting the project.

```bash
# start ngrok to intercept the data exchanged on port 8080
ngrok http 8080
```

Next, you must update **FRONTEND_URL** in .env file using the https url defined by ngrok, for example `https://71fbdd1a.ngrok.io`.

If you already have configured Google with `http://localhost:8080`, Google login won't work until you replace the **FRONTEND_URL** in .env to localhost.

- Visit <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook Developers</a>
- Click **My Apps**, then select *Add a New App* from the dropdown menu
- Enter a new name for your app
- Click on the **Create App ID** button
- Find the Facebook Login Product and click on **Set up**
- Instead of going through their Quickstart, go to your App Settings. Click on **Settings > Basic** in the left nav
- Copy and paste *App ID* and *App Secret* keys into `.env`
- **Note:** *App ID* is **FACEBOOK_ID**, *App Secret* is **FACEBOOK_SECRET** in `.env`
- Enter `localhost` under *App Domains*
- Choose a **Category** that best describes your app
- Click on **+ Add Platform** and select **Website**
- Enter `http://localhost:8080` under *Site URL*
- Click on **Facebook Login** tab in the left nav and choose *Settings*
- Enter `https://xxxxx.ngrok.io/auth/facebook/callback` under Valid OAuth redirect URIs *(you need to create this route on your frontend application)*

FAQ
---

### I am getting MongoDB Connection Error, how do I fix it?
That's a custom error message defined in `app.js` to indicate that there was a
problem connecting to MongoDB:

```js
mongoose.connection.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error(err);
  console.log('%s MongoDB connection error. Please make sure MongoDB is running.', chalk.red('âœ—'));
  process.exit();
});
```
You need to have a MongoDB server running before launching `app.js`. You can
download MongoDB [here](http://mongodb.org/downloads), or install it via a package manager.

Windows users, read [Install MongoDB on Windows](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).

**Tip:** If you are always connected to the internet, you could just use
[mLab](https://mlab.com/) or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/) instead
of downloading and installing MongoDB locally. You will only need to update database credentials
in `.env` file.

### I get an error when I deploy my app, why?
Chances are you haven't changed the *Database URI* in `.env`. If `MONGODB` is
set to `localhost`, it will only work on your machine as long as MongoDB is
running. When you deploy to Heroku, OpenShift or some other provider, you will not have MongoDB
running on `localhost`. You need to create an account with [mLab](https://mongolab.com/)
or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/), then create a free tier database.


### How do I switch SendGrid for another email delivery service, like Mailgun or SparkPost?
Inside the `nodemailer.createTransport` method arguments, simply change the service from `'Sendgrid'` to some other email service. Also, be sure to update both username and password below that. See the [list of all supported services](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer-wellknown#supported-services) by Nodemailer.

Set up online database *(not required)*
----------


<img src="https://mlab.com/company/img/branding/mLab-logo-onlight.svg" width="200">

- Open [mlab.com](https://mlab.com) website
- Click the yellow **Sign up** button
- Fill in your user information then hit **Create account**
- From the dashboard, click on **:zap:Create new** button
- Select **any** cloud provider (I usually go with AWS)
- Under *Plan* click on **Single-node (development)** tab and select **Sandbox** (it's free)
 - *Leave MongoDB version as is - `2.4.x`*
- Enter *Database name** for your web app
- Then click on **:zap:Create new MongoDB deployment** button
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user
- Click to the recently created database
- You should see the following message:
 - *A database user is required to connect to this database.* **Click here** *to create a new one.*
- Click the link and fill in **DB Username** and **DB Password** fields
- Finally, in `.env` instead of `mongodb://localhost:27017/test`, use the following URI with your credentials:
 - `db: 'mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@ds027479.mongolab.com:27479/DATABASE_NAME'`

**Note:** As an alternative to mLab, there is also [Compose](https://www.compose.io/).
